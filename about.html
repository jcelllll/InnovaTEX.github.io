            <p class="about-par">Embarking on the quest for a perfect vacation spot led us to the picturesque haven of Samal Island. Enthralled by its serene landscapes and the promise of a tranquil escape, our excitement was momentarily overshadowed by a nagging concern – what if disaster struck amidst this paradise? The thought lingered, amplified by the bustling influx of visitors drawn to this scenic destination. The realization struck deep: there was a pressing need for a comprehensive resource, a sanctuary of information, equipped to offer guidance, maps, and crucial insights into an array of potential disasters – earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, and fires. <br> <br>
            
            The vision for this endeavor sparked from a shared moment of realization – a realization that resonated profoundly within a group of bright minds, students navigating the halls of learning at the University of the Philippines Mindanao. United by a pursuit of knowledge in the realms of Computer Science, our collective curiosity extended beyond the realms of academia. It converged with a profound sense of responsibility, spurred by our shared love for exploration and travel. As avid enthusiasts of adventure and discovery, we found ourselves contemplating the safety and well-being of fellow travelers, fostering a collective concern that catalyzed the genesis of this vital platform.</p>
